#Antoine Calculator app

An app to calculate the saturation pressure and the saturation temperature with Antoine's equation.

On the main window the user can search by compound name or formula. After clicking the search button the user will be 
redirected to the calculator page where it can be calculated the saturation pressure, the saturation temperature and
the user can visualize the A, B and C constants used in the calculation.

This is my first project and it's focused on learning and improving Python skills, managing repositoires and using 
github tools.
